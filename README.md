# Human-or-IA-Differentiator
This work tackles distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text using two methods: vector-based machine learning and word-emotion distribution comparisons.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

The identification of computer-generated text has become increasingly important due to the impressive generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, which make detection challenging.

This project addresses the classification task of distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, as part of the **AuTexTification: Automated Text Identification** challenge at IberLEF 2023.

## ðŸš€ Approaches Implemented

Two different methods were explored:

1. **Vector Representations & Machine Learning**  
   Utilizing vector embeddings and classification algorithms to model textual features.

2. **Word & Emotion Distribution Analysis**  
   Calculating distributions of words and emotions and measuring distances between these distributions to identify text origin.
